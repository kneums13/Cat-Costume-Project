            <h2> About Kat </h2>
            <p>
              Kat is the ultimate cat lady you've always dreamed you could
              be. Never has a Halloween gone by where her twelve cats weren't
              all dressed to impress. Five years ago, she decided to open
              Kat's Costume Shop to share her passion with the world.

              the store and modeling the latest trends.
